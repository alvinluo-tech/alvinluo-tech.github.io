## üéØ Introduction

I'm excited to share my latest project - **FocusTimer**, a modern desktop focus timer application designed to help you stay productive and manage your time effectively. Built with cutting-edge technologies like Tauri 2.0, React 19, and Rust, this cross-platform app brings the power of the Pomodoro Technique and flexible time tracking to your desktop.

::github{repo="alvinluo-tech/tauri-FocusTimer"}

## üí° Why I Built This

As a software developer, I've always struggled with time management and staying focused during work sessions. While there are many timer apps available, I wanted something that:

- **Runs natively** on my desktop with minimal resource usage
- **Tracks time flexibly** - both countdown and forward timing modes
- **Organizes tasks** into meaningful groups
- **Provides detailed statistics** to understand my time allocation
- **Works offline** without any cloud dependency
- **Looks modern** with a clean, customizable interface

That's when I decided to build FocusTimer using Tauri - a framework that combines the power of Rust with the flexibility of web technologies.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Task Management

FocusTimer allows you to organize your work into **task groups** and **individual tasks**. For example, you might create a "Work Projects" group with tasks like "Code Review", "Feature Development", and "Bug Fixes", or a "Learning" group with tasks for different subjects you're studying.

**Task Creation Options:**
- **Preset times**: Quick select 25, 30, 45 minutes, or 1 hour
- **Custom duration**: Set any specific time in minutes
- **Forward timer**: Unlimited timing to track actual time spent

### ‚è∞ Flexible Timer Modes

The app supports two distinct timing modes:

1. **Countdown Mode**: Set a fixed duration and watch the timer count down to zero - perfect for the Pomodoro Technique
2. **Forward Timer Mode**: Start an unlimited timer to track exactly how long you spend on a task

Both modes feature:
- Large, readable time display
- Visual progress bar (countdown mode)
- Pause, resume, stop, and reset controls
- Customizable backgrounds for different states

### üìä Comprehensive Statistics

One of my favorite features is the powerful statistics system. You can:

- View stats across **multiple time periods**: today, this week, last 15 days, this month, or custom date ranges
- Analyze by **task** or by **task group**
- See detailed metrics: total duration, session count, completion rate
- **Toggle between chart view and list view** for different perspectives
- Interactive pie charts showing time distribution across tasks

The statistics help you understand where your time goes and make informed decisions about time allocation.

### üé® Customization

Make the timer your own:
- **Background options**: solid colors, gradients, or custom images
- **Separate backgrounds** for running and paused states
- **Transparency controls** for a subtle, elegant look
- **Multi-language support**: Full Chinese and English interfaces

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

Building FocusTimer was an exciting technical journey. Here's what powers it:

### Frontend
- **React 19**: Latest features for a smooth, reactive UI
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development and optimized builds
- **Recharts**: Beautiful data visualizations
- **Lucide React**: Clean, consistent icons

### Backend
- **Rust**: Memory-safe, blazingly fast backend logic
- **Tauri 2.0**: Modern framework for building lightweight desktop apps
- **SQLite + SQLx**: Type-safe database operations with zero runtime overhead
- **date-fns**: Powerful date manipulation

### Why Tauri?

I chose Tauri over alternatives like Electron because:
- **Smaller bundle size**: ~3-5 MB vs 100+ MB for Electron apps
- **Lower memory footprint**: Uses the system's webview instead of bundling Chromium
- **Native performance**: Rust backend handles heavy lifting efficiently
- **Security**: Built-in security features and careful API design
- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase for Windows, macOS, and Linux
